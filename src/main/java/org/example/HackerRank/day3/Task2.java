//    Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player
//
//always moves first, and both players always play optimally.The rules of the game are as follows:
//
//    Initially there are
//
//towers.
//Each tower is of height
//.
//The players move in alternating turns.
//In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height
//and reduce its height to , where and evenly divides
//
//    .
//    If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
//
//Given the values of
//and , determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return . Otherwise, return
//
//.
//
//Example.
//
//There are towers, each units tall. Player has a choice of two moves:
//- remove pieces from a tower to leave as
//- remove pieces to leave Let Player remove . Now the towers are and
//
//units tall.
//
//Player
//matches the move. Now the towers are both
//
//units tall.
//
//Now Player
//
//has only one move.
//
//Player
//removes pieces leaving . Towers are and units tall.
//Player matches again. Towers are both
//
//unit tall.
//
//Player
//has no move and loses. Return
//
//.
//
//Function Description
//
//Complete the towerBreakers function in the editor below.
//
//towerBreakers has the following paramter(s):
//
//    int n: the number of towers
//    int m: the height of each tower
//
//Returns
//
//    int: the winner of the game
//
//Input Format
//
//The first line contains a single integer
//, the number of test cases.
//Each of the next lines describes a test case in the form of space-separated integers, and
//
//.
//
//Constraints
//
//Sample Input
//
//STDIN   Function
//-----   --------
//2       t = 2
//2 2     n = 2, m = 2
//1 4     n = 1, m = 4
//
//Sample Output
//
//2
//1
//
//Explanation
//
//We'll refer to player
//as and player as In the first test case, chooses one of the two towers and reduces it to . Then reduces the remaining tower to a height of . As both towers now have height , cannot make a move so
//
//is the winner.
//
//In the second test case, there is only one tower of height
//. can reduce it to a height of either or . chooses as both players always choose optimally. Because has no possible move, wins.
